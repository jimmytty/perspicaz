Using /tramp-adb/ is easy to access /Android/'s filesystem and /shell/, but we still need the [[https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb.html][Android Debug Bridge]] (and all the Java configuration pain included...).

I didn't know this /Emacs/'s feature and started using it recently. For example, to access my old current phone, I plug it to /USB/ port and hit into /Emacs/:

:,----
:| C-x C-f /adb:
:`----

And the device is autocompleted.

Move, rename and delete files are fine with /Dired/ and /eshell/ is good as /sh/, but, for now, I don't know how to inform /eshell/ to use the device's root instead the root of my laptop... I need to research more and make this a better workflow to tests and day tasks.
